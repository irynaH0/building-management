# Building Management
This repository contains nine projects developed as part of the Programming Paradigms course at TU Wien (WS2024/25). The tasks and requirements were designed by TU Wien, but all code was independently written by our team of three students (see colaborators).

The projects explore various programming paradigms and advanced concepts, including object-oriented programming, functional programming, generics, type safety, and concurrent programming. Each project focuses on solving specific building management problems through software design and implementation.

## Projects Overview
### Type Hierarchies and Subtyping
Implementation of correct subtyping relationships and substitutability principles. We tested our solution with comprehensive test cases to ensure type safety without relying on instanceof or casting.

### Generics and Containers
Creation of generic containers and iterators without using built-in collections or arrays. We developed custom implementations focusing on type safety and correct use of wildcards.

### Building Structures and Statistical Analysis
Development of two versions of office and building management systems: one using generics and another without. We included detailed statistical methods to analyze room usage, lighting, and space allocation.

### Heating Systems Management
Simulation of office units with heating systems using multiple inheritance, dynamic binding, and annotation-driven metadata extraction. We ensured proper substitutability principles and avoided forbidden language constructs like type casts or dynamic type checks.

### Functional Programming for Building Optimization
Solving an optimization problem for building structures using a functional programming approach. We utilized Java Streams and higher-order functions to ensure clean, side-effect-free code.

### Concurrent Simulation of Emergency Exits
Simulation of people evacuating a building using concurrent programming, threads, and inter-process communication. We designed two separate processes—one for simulation and another for collecting data at the assembly point—ensuring correct synchronization and avoiding deadlocks.
