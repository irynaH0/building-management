/**
 * The abstract Cost class represents a generic cost related to a building's lifecycle.
 * It contains an `amount` attribute representing the financial value of the cost.
 * This class provides the basic functionality to get and modify the cost amount, while
 * its subclasses implement specific behaviors for increasing the different type of cost based on the building type.
