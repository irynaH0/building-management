/**
 * The abstract Material class represents a general material used in the construction, waste, or recycling process of a building.
 * Each material has a quantity, a CO2 emission factor, and a reusability coefficient, which defines how much of it can be reused.
 * It also provides methods for getting the material's quantity and CO2 value, increasing the quantity, and resetting it to zero.
 * Pre: The reusability parameter must be between 0 and 1, throws IllegalArgumentException otherwise.
 * Post: Material object is initialized with given attributes.
