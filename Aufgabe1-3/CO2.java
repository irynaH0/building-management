// GOOD: The class encapsulates CO2 emission data effectively,

// GOOD: The amount variable is private, ensuring encapsulation and
// preventing unauthorized external modifications.

// BAD: Lack of input validation in constructors and methods can lead to invariant violations
// and inconsistent object state.
